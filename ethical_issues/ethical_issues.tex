\chapter{Ethical Issues}

This project does not contain many ethical issues as it does not use any private, sensitive data for training any of the models that will be used. Moreover, we are not including any form of physical materials that could harm any human or animal or provide any environmental impacts. The only consideration is the list of controversial topics we will be curating for our inference testing. Some of the topics may produce harmful content that could offend certain groups of people. However, this type of data may be necessary to be able to accurately test our hypothesis and be able to create correctly functioning models. To this end, we will make sure not to use any potentially hateful messages explicitly in the report so as to not potentially offend anyone simply reading the report of this project.

A minor environmental issue will be my use of Imperial College London's Department of Computing GPU cluster. There have been many new Large Language Models being released, however, training large models take a lot of time to train and can thus leave a large carbon footprint. We have seen this with ChatGPT (which uses the GPT-3 model), the carbon footprint for training the model was equivalent to releasing over 500 tons of CO2e \cite{chat_gpt_environment}. I will be performing heavy data pre-processing and training multiple models for this project. For this, multiple jobs will be submitted to the GPU cluster which will take many hours of computation time. Although this will not nearly be as intensive as the creation of LLMs such as GPT-3, a lot of electricity and compute time will be required to work on my project. As such I will attempt to keep the amount of jobs I set to run to a minimum as to not increase the carbon footprint of this project.

We will also comply with any licensing that will arise from using training data, pre-trained models or language models to create data and ensure any data we do use has been obtained legally and ethically. Finally, we will ensure that any data used does not have personally identifying data attached.
