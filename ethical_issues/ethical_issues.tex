\chapter{Ethical Issues}

This project does not contain many ethical issues as it does not use any private, sensitive data for training any of the models that will be used. Moreover, we are not including any form of physical materials that could harm any human or animal or provide any environmental impacts. The only consideration is the list of controversial topics we will be curating for our inference testing. Some of the topics may produce harmful content that could offend certain groups of people. However, this type of data may be necessary to be able to accurately test our hypothesis and be able to create correctly functioning models. To this end, we will make sure not to use any potentially hateful messages explicitly in the report so as to not potentially offend anyone simply reading the report of this project.

We will also comply with any licensing that will arise from using training data, pre-trained models or language models to create data and ensure any data we do use has been obtained legally and ethically. Finally, we will ensure that any data used does not have personally identifying data attached.
